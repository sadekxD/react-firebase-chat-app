                    EVERY SINNER SHOULD READ THIS
                    1- The prophet Muhammed (PBUH) said in an authentic narration in Buhari "Whosoever recites "Soob-Han-Allahee-Wa-Bee-Hum-deehee" (this is how its pronounced in english and it means "hallowed be Allah and I praise him) 100 times a day will have their sins forgiven even if they're as much as the foam of the sea !!
                    2- In another authentic narration in Muslim  the prophet Muhammed (PBUH) said "Whoever says "Soob-Han-Allahee-Wa-Bee-Hum-Dee-Hee" (this is how its pronounced in english) 100 times in the morning and 100 times in the evening then nobody can do better than this person on the day of judgement except the one whom recites it more !!!
                    3- The prophet Muhammed (PBUH) said in an authentic narration by Shaddad Bin Aus that " The most superior way of asking forgiveness (search google - "Sayyid al Istighfar" for meaning) from Allah is to say (I am writing it the way you would pronounce it in english) -  "Allahoomma anta Rab-bee, La ee-laahe eella anta, Anta khalaktanee ve ene abdooke,  
                    wa ana ala ahdeeke, wa wawadeeke mástátátoo, Audhu bike min sharee ma sánátoo, Aboo-oo leke beenee meteeke aleyye,  wa eboo-oo leke bee thumbee faa feer lee, eennahoo laa  yaa feeroo athoonoobe eellaa anta" 
                    and the prophet continued to say " Whomever recites it during the day with firm faith in it and dies on the same day before the evening he will be from the people of paradise and if someone recites it at night with firm faith in it and dies before the morning he will be from the people of paradise " (Buhari)
